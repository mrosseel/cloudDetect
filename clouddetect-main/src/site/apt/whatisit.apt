What is it?

	Cloud detect is a program to process webcam images of the night sky and decide whether it's clear or not.
	There are several ways to do this, but at the moment only one is employed: the contrast between the sky and a foreground object
	is measured, the more contrast the more clouds we have. This is because of light pollution and it might be the only slightly positive
	side benefit... . The second method works with dark skies as well: count the number of stars in a sky image.
